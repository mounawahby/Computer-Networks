# Computer-Networks - ARP

Nodes	 on	 the	 same	 subnet	 communicate	 using	 MAC	 addresses	 and	 the	 Address	 Resolution	
Protocol aka ARP,	 is	 used	 to	 resolve	 IP	 addresses	 into	 MAC	 addresses.	 When	 a host	 A	 needs	 to	
communicate	to	host	B	on	the	same	subnet,	host	A	sends	packets	using	host	B’s	MAC	address.	

### WHAT

This is a simplified	version	of the	ARP	protocol.
